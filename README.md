CanetisRarar is open-source application for helping with recognizing sound direction in games. It has overlay that can be used in games and it uses 7.1 audio to calculate sound direction.

## About this fork
This is just a custom, personal fork. As a deaf player I just wanted to make some adjustment to it :)

## Downside
Can't support fullscreen game, so instead of using it as an overlay, I use it on my second screen.

## How to use
You need 7.1 audio device to be connected and selected as primary speaker, but don´t worry. You can also use virtual audio device. First of all check if your sound card or headphones does not support it and if they don´t use this guide.

 1. Download [VB-Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/)
 2. Install it
 3. **Reboot PC**
 4. Go to sound settings 
 5. Open *Playback* tab
 6. Set *CABLE Input* as default
 7. Click on *Configure*

 10. Click on CABLE Output and click *Properties*
